# Machine Learning

Hey, this is a some of my machine learning projects. Code is written in Python, Matlab and R. Some projects are LTH coursework from my MSc in Engineering Physics degree with ML specialisation and some projects are just for fun :)

## Regression
- Penalized with cross-validation
- Linear
- Logistic
- Ordinal

## Classification & Clustering
- SVM & K-means for image classification
- The Perceptron and logistic regression

## Neural Networks
- Feed-forward neural network for image classification

## Probabilistic Reasoning
- Localise a robot in an enviroment without landmarks

## Reinforcement Learning
    - Agent playing snake
