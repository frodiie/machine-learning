# Machine Learning

Hi, here are some of my machine learning projects. Code is written in Python, Matlab and R :)

## Regression
- Penalized with cross-validation
- Linear
- Logistic
- Ordinal

## Classification & Clustering
- SVM & K-means for image classification
- The Perceptron and logistic regression

## Neural Networks
- Feed-forward neural network for image classification

## Probabilistic Reasoning
- Localise a robot in an enviroment without landmarks

## Reinforcement Learning
- Agent playing snake
